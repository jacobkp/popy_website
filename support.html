        <div class="faq-item open">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Popy is a local-first productivity app that serves as your personal second brain. It helps you save articles, notes, meeting recordings, voice memos, tasks, and tools—all in one searchable place. Think of it as a home for all the information that typically gets scattered across browser tabs, messaging apps, and random documents.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Which platforms does Popy support?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Popy is currently available for macOS. We also offer a Chrome extension that works alongside the macOS app to help you save content from your browser. The extension requires the macOS app to be installed.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Is my data private?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, absolutely. Popy is built with a local-first architecture, which means all your content—notes, articles, meetings, tasks—lives on your device, not our servers. When AI features like transcription or summaries are used, the data is processed and immediately discarded, never stored or used for training. Read our full <a href="privacy.html" style="color: var(--color-teal); text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How does Popy handle meeting recordings?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Popy can record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings. The recordings are stored locally on your device. Transcription is powered by third-party AI providers, but the audio is processed and discarded immediately—it's never stored on external servers or used to train AI models.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I search across everything I've saved?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! One of Popy's core features is unified search. You can search across all your saved content—articles, notes, meeting transcripts, voice memos, and tasks—from a single search box. Everything is indexed locally for fast, private searching.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need an internet connection to use Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most of Popy's features work offline since your data is stored locally. However, certain features like AI-powered transcription, summaries, and saving web content require an internet connection.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do I save articles to Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can save articles using the Chrome extension with one click while browsing. The extension captures the full article text and stores it in Popy for distraction-free reading later. You can also copy and paste article links directly into the macOS app.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Does Popy sync across devices?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Currently, Popy is focused on the macOS experience. Sync functionality may be added in future updates based on user feedback.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Is there a free trial?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Information about pricing and trials will be available at launch. Check back soon or download the app to get the latest information.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do I organize my content in Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Popy is designed to minimize organizational busywork. Instead of manually creating folders and tags, Popy organizes everything chronologically and automatically connects related items. You can find things through powerful search rather than remembering where you filed them.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I export my data from Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Since your data lives locally on your device, you always have full access to it. Export functionality for standard formats may be added in future updates.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What happens if I uninstall Popy?<span class="faq-chevron"></span></h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>When you uninstall Popy, all local data is removed from your device. Make sure to export any important content before uninstalling if you want to keep it.</p>
