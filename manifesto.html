    <h1>Extend your memory. For the things that slip through.</h1>
    <p>Articles you saved, tools you discovered, meetings you had, thoughts you captured—all in one simple, familiar, searchable place.</p>

    <!-- Section 1: The Problem -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>You already have a system. It's just scattered.</h2>
      <p>You're not disorganized. You're adapting.</p>
      <p>When you need to save something quickly, you use what's closest: browser tabs, self-messages on WhatsApp, scattered notes across different apps, voice memos you forget to revisit.</p>
      <p>These aren't bad habits. They're survival tactics in a world that demands you capture everything but gives you nowhere good to put it all.</p>
      <p>The problem isn't you. It's that your information lives in a dozen different places, each with its own logic, search, and organizational nightmare.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: The Solution -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>Familiar actions. One place.</h2>
      <p>Popy doesn't reinvent how you work. It gives your existing instincts a home.</p>
      <p>Save an article? It goes to Popy. Found a useful tool? Popy. Had a meeting with action items? Popy. Random thought while walking? Popy.</p>
      <p>Same muscle memory you already have—bookmark, save, capture—just pointed at one calm, searchable place instead of scattered chaos.</p>
      <p>No complicated organizational systems. No folders to maintain. No tags you'll forget. Just save it, and find it later when you need it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: What Popy Keeps Track Of -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>What Popy keeps track of.</h2>

      <p><strong>Reads:</strong> Articles, blog posts, papers. Save them with one click from anywhere. Read them later in a clean, distraction-free view. Every article you've ever saved is searchable, even years later.</p>

      <p><strong>Finds:</strong> Tools you discovered, products someone recommended, resources you want to remember. That design tool your colleague mentioned? The developer library you saw on Twitter? It's all there when you need it.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Thoughts, ideas, observations. Write them down without worrying about organization. Popy automatically connects related ideas and surfaces them when they're relevant.</p>

      <p><strong>Meetings:</strong> Record and transcribe conversations. Get automatic summaries and action items. Search across every meeting you've ever had to find that one decision you vaguely remember discussing.</p>

      <p><strong>Voice:</strong> Quick thoughts while commuting, cooking, or away from your desk. Automatically transcribed and searchable. Your spoken ideas become findable text.</p>

      <p><strong>Tasks:</strong> Simple to-do tracking with full context. Each task remembers where it came from—which meeting, which article, which conversation. Weeks later, you'll know exactly why you added it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: How It Works -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>One timeline. Everything connected.</h2>
      <p>Popy organizes everything chronologically, the way your brain naturally thinks about time and context.</p>
      <p>An article you saved six months ago can surface alongside yesterday's meeting notes about the same topic. Your voice memo from this morning links to a task you created last week. Context flows between everything you capture.</p>
      <p>Search works across all of it. One search box finds articles, notes, meeting transcripts, tasks—everything. Because information doesn't naturally live in silos, and neither should your search.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 5: Privacy -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>Your thoughts stay yours.</h2>
      <p>Popy is local-first. Your data lives on your device, not our servers. We can't read your notes, we don't train AI on your content, and we're not in the business of selling your attention.</p>
      <p>Your ideas, your meetings, your thoughts—they're private by default, not as a premium feature.</p>
      <p>We sync between your devices using end-to-end encryption. Even we can't see what you're syncing.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 6: Philosophy -->
    <section class="page-section">
      <h2>Not superhuman. Just a bit more on top of things.</h2>
      <p>Popy won't revolutionize your life. It won't make you 10x more productive. It won't turn you into a content machine.</p>
      <p>It will help you remember that article you read last month. It will surface the tool someone recommended. It will remind you what you agreed to in that meeting.</p>
      <p>Small wins. Consistent relief. Less mental overhead spent trying to remember where you put things.</p>
      <p>We made a home for the misfits—the thoughts and captures that never quite fit anywhere else. Not a perfect system. Just a calm, familiar place where everything can exist together, and actually be found again.</p>
